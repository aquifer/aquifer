 * One example of the simplest connection array is shown below. To use the
 * sample settings, copy and uncomment the code below between the @code and
 * @endcode lines and paste it after the $databases declaration. You will need
 * to replace the database username and password and possibly the host and port
 * with the appropriate credentials for your database system.
 *
 * The next section describes how to customize the $databases array for more
 * specific needs.
 *
 * @code
 * $databases['default']['default'] = array (
 *   'database' => 'databasename',
 *   'username' => 'sqlusername',
 *   'password' => 'sqlpassword',
 *   'host' => 'localhost',
